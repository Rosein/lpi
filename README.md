### The Linux Programming Interface

This repositories contain my answers to the exercises of the (amazing) book
[The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/).

Feel free to take a look at them and even suggest improvements. If you are reading
the book as well, make sure to try yourself first! Learning comes from your own
practice.

Have fun!
